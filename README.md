## ‚ú® Core Philosophy

In a world of data, context is everything. Wellnex was built on the principle that your health data should work *for* you. It's not just a digital diary; it's an intelligent partner that understands your recent state to provide more relevant, supportive, and actionable advice.

## üöÄ Key Features

*   üß† **Context-Aware AI Assistant:** Our standout feature. Before you even ask a question, Wellnex fetches your latest sleep and mood data. This context is sent to the Groq API along with your query, allowing for a deeply personalized and empathetic conversation.

*   üìä **Dynamic Wellness Logging:** Log what matters to you with an intelligent, adaptive form. Whether you're tracking your **sleep quality**, **mood**, **water intake**, **exercise sessions**, or **blood pressure**, the interface provides exactly the fields you need.

*   üîê **Secure & Versatile Authentication:** Your data is private and secure. Wellnex provides multiple ways to sign in, ensuring easy access for everyone:
    *   Email & Password
    *   Google Sign-In
    *   Phone Number (with OTP Verification)

*   üìà **Visual Health Dashboard:** Your home screen acts as a personal dashboard, providing an at-a-glance view of your most recent wellness logs in a clean, beautifully designed list.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   You must have the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed on your machine.
*   An IDE like VS Code or Android Studio.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Set Up Your Own Firebase Project**
    *   Create a new project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Install the Firebase CLI on your machine if you haven't already.
    *   From your project's root directory, run the following command and follow the prompts to connect the app to your own Firebase project. This will generate a new `lib/firebase_options.dart` file.
      ```sh
      flutterfire configure
      ```

3.  **Create an Environment File for API Keys**
    This project uses the Groq API for its AI features. You must provide your own API key.
    *   Go to the [Groq Cloud Console](https://console.groq.com/keys) to get your free API key.
    *   In the root directory of this project, create a file named `.env`.
    *   Add your API key to this file like so:
      ```
      GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_groq_api_key_here
      ```
      _Note: The `.gitignore` file is already configured to keep this file private._

4.  **Install Dependencies**
    Run the following command to get all the required packages:
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

5.  **Run the App**
    Now you're ready to launch the app on your emulator or physical device!
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```
